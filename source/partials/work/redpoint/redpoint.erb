			<h1>Redpoint // Product Design Work</h1>
			<p>Redpoint is a product built for both external Catalyze HL7 customers as well as internal integration engineers. At it's core Redpoint gives users a way to manage integrations with Health Systems. Redpoint automates the creation of interfaces and management of VPN appliances.</p>

		<h3>In it's current form Redpoint gives users the ability to quickly build connections with a Health System via a secure VPN connection, request the creation of new interfaces, view metrics about interfaces associated with health systems, and manage access to environment clusters.</h3>

		<p>The journey towards Redpoint V1 started with a prototype code named Newton. We knew that we wanted to begin automating a lot of our existing integration services, but we didn't know what exactly that should look like. Over the course of a few weeks I put together a prototype with a hodgepodge of ideas and features. Below you'll find a series screenshots of the prototype showing various views. Note - this was built using Angular JS and a custom Sass framework I developed in house at Catalyze.</p>

		<p>Since selling to healthcare institutions can often be a complex three headed beast the core purpose of this early prototype was to gain valuable insight about it's utility from potential buyers. Once we had validated our idea of the product in the marketplace we'd then design a new experience around real users. These prototypes included two core features that we knew were vital to our success. Those include the ability to create an interface and to view metrics about interface usage.</p>
		<p>Once the product was validated I then started to explore what an initial release might look like. Developed shortly after the previous prototypes, below is a series of screenshots eventually building to a functioning beta of Newton.</p>

		<p>This Beta was released to a very small set of Catalyze HL7 users. We wanted to follow up with them directly by doing a round of user testing. During this testing we found that our underpinnings were solid, but naming conventions and complexity were still an issue. So before the initial V1 release we needed to clean up those issues.</p>
		<p>Below you'll find screenshots of the latest release of Newton. Things of note include a new product name – Redpoint, a new color scheme to compliment the name, different nomenclature for VPN connections and health systems – connectors, different nomenclature for interfaces – scripts</p>
