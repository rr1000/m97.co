I have always been infatuated with drawing, and I never really saw it as more than that. Drawing is not art or design to me. It’s a process by which I pass time.

As a child I would come home and start drawing after school, mostly I liked to observe shapes and then redraw them. I would constantly find images in magazines and newspapers to trace. I loved copying others’ work.

Tracing and copying eventually turned into an interest of TV programs like Bob Ross. This eventually allowed me to create my own images from real life, things around me: trees, cars, people, etc. My creativity had grown through the process of replication.

I attended college in 2008. A time when modern web design was really starting to make its mark. Colleges began adding more and more web-centric design courses. Human-computer interaction, New Media Development, Flash, etc. were discussed constantly within the Graphic Design Department.

As web based design grew more prolific and software started to move from native to the web, I also made a move.

Eager to learn more about technology I decided to transfer colleges to continue pursuing a Bachelors degree in Graphic Design, and with a hope that I could learn more about technology and engineering.

### My years at R.I.T.

During my three years at R.I.T. I was lucky enough to study under several amazing design professors. Individuals like Kris Holmes and Chuck Bigelow, inventors of hundreds of modern typefaces (Many of which first appeared in the original Macintosh computer).

Throughout the course of my study I inter-weaved fine art classes with technology and engineering courses. A year in, I added a minor in Science, Technology and Society, which is a sociological minor that explores how technology can change the behaviors of groups of individuals and vice-versa. At the same time, I also changed majors from Graphic Design to Applied Arts and Sciences.

After these big changes, the classes I chose bore no restriction. My only requirements were to establish solid cases for how a certain class would benefit my education.

Enter Gradesnap During my junior year at R.I.T. I started working on a side project (eventually called Gradesnap) with my good friend Nikko. This project dealt with grading multiple choice tests by capturing an image of the answer sheet. We wanted to create a suite of statistics that a potential educator could use to further analyze their students’ work on top the automated grading aspect of the program. Eventually Gradesnap turned into a startup that went through the High Tech Rochester lean launchpad accelerator.

Unfortunately, as is the fate of many startups, Gradesnap eventually folded after two and half years (too much bureaucracy when selling software to public schools).

After Gradesnap I graduated college and started working as a Front-end Web Developer at a creative agency near Washington D.C.

My passion for client work slowly grew weak and my urge to work on sustainable software products, and more importantly, companies trying to make a positive difference in the world, grew stronger.

### Currently

I now work from the West Coast in Portland Oregon as the director of design at Catalyze. We’re building software development tools for healthcare developers. Our goal is to usher in the new age of value based patient care by giving innovative companies the tools they need to succeed in operating within health systems.
